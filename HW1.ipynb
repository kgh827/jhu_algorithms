    "An adjacency matrix is an nxn matric where A[i][j] = weight when there is an edge from node i --> j, and 0 otherwise.  Adjacency matrices use O(n^2) space because it stores a value for each pair of vertices (A[i][j] = weight) which allows it to be used for dense graphs effectively because the lookup cost is only O(1) which is good for matrix based math computations.  On the other hand, adjacency matrices result in poor space utilization for sparse, large graphs with a small number of edges.  \n",

    "An adjacency list contains a list of each nodes direct neighbors.  Adjacency lists use O(V + E) space (vertices + edges) because it only stores edges which is more efficient for sparse graphs and allows for easy iteration over neighbor nodes.  This also allows for better performance in large graphs because of flexible and easy to interpret weights.  The downside to adjacency lists is that it results in a slower edge lookup because it may have to scan neighbors due to the adjacency list only storing direct neighbors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For Breadth-First Search (BFS) / Depth-First Search (DFS), adjacency lists are usually preferred because BFS/DFS can run in O(V + E) time when iterating only over real neighbors. With an adjacency matrix, “finding the neighbors” of a node means scanning the entire row (about O(Vertices) per node), so traversals often end up closer to O(Vertices^2) overall.  With MST algorithms, Kruskal’s is typically better for sparse graphs because it works well when edges are stored efficiently (like an adjacency list / edge list), while Prim’s can be simpler to use on dense graphs, where an adjacency matrix allows for \"low cost\" lookups of O(1)."

    "Breadth-First Search (BFS) navigates a graph level-by-level using a First In First Out (FIFO) queue. Because it checks all nodes that are 1 edge away, then 2 edges away, etc., BFS gives the shortest-hop path in an unweighted graph which provides the minimum number of edges from the start node. Depth-First Search (DFS) explores deep-first using a stack or recursion, meaning it follows one path as far as it can before backtracking, so it does not guarantee the shortest path because it might reach a node using a longer route first.\n",

An MST is not the same as a shortest-path tree because an MST minimizes the overall sum of the selected edges across the whole graph, while a shortest-path tree minimizes the distance from one chosen start node to every other node. MSTs are important in AI because they allow for the creation of low cost cycle free networks which allow for the optimization of networks on a global level rather than on a connection by connection basis.  These type of network optimization algorithms can be used in many AI related system level applications such as determining optimal network structure for large scale (power systems management) or small scale systems (sensor communication in autonomous vehicles)."
